        <h3>2. Mission of PCI</h3>
        <p class="mb-10">
          The PCI SSC mission is to enhance global payment account data security by developing standards and supporting services that drive education, awareness, and effective implementation by stakeholders. We achieve this with a strategic framework to guide our decision-making process and ensure that every initiative is aligned with our mission and supports the needs of the global payments industry.
          The four pillars of our strategic framework include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><i class="font-bold">Increase industry participation and knowledge</i> in the PCI Standards development process and stakeholder support for standards implementation. This ensures that standards and resources reflect and address industry needs and challenges.</li>  
          <li><i class="font-bold">Evolve security standards and validation</i>  programs to support a range of environments, technologies and methodologies for achieving security. This ensures standards and resources that support and enable safe commerce and the flexibility to use different approaches to meet those standards.</li>  
          <li><i class="font-bold">Secure emerging payment channels </i> via development of PCI Standards and resources to support broader payment acceptance. This enables safe commerce in new and emerging card and card-based payment channels such as mobile and internet-of-things.</li>  
          <li><i class="font-bold">Increase standards alignment and consistency </i>  of PCI Standards to minimize redundancy and support effective implementation.</li>  
        </ul>
